# snake_game
The creation of the original snake game (no touching the sides!)

The game is simple. You start out as a small snake. Dots will appear on the screen - they are your food. 
The hungry snake that you are will eat as much food as you can, growing a little with every bite, until eventually
you grow so large that it becomes impossible to not bumb into yourself!

## Rules: 
1) No touching the sides. Touch the sides and you die.
2) No touching yourself (hehe). Touch yourself and -you guessed it -you die.

## Controls:
To move up and down, left and right, simply use the direction (arrow) keys on your keyboard.

### Technical Functionality:
Run the programme from main.py. With object-oriented programming (OOP), main.py creates objects from classes defined in the other python files, food.py, scoreboard.py, and snake.py. So long as you have all files saved in the same folder, the programme should run smoothly. Simply open main.py and execute the code. 

Have fun!
